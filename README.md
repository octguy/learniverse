# What AI Can Do

## 1. Toxic Comment Moderation

### Goal:

- Keep learning environment healthy.
- Prevent spam, toxic, hate speech, sexual, ads.

### How it works:

1. When user submits comment, system calls AI moderation API.
2. AI returns scores (e.g. toxic=0.85, spam=0.2).
3. If above threshold (toxic > 0.8) ‚Üí auto delete.
4. If warning level (0.5‚Äì0.8) ‚Üí show to user but flag for mod.

### Technology:

- Model: OpenAI moderation API, Perspective API (Google), or open-source models like Detoxify (BERT fine-tuned).
- Pipeline: API Gateway ‚Üí Moderation Service (AI) ‚Üí DB ‚Üí Notification mod.

## 2) Semantic Search

### Goal:

- Users search content by meaning, not just keywords.
- Support Vietnamese with/without accents, typos.

### How it works:

- When user enters query, system:
  - Step 1: Normalize (lowercase, remove accents, typo correction via AI).
  - Step 2: Use embedding model to encode query ‚Üí vector.
  - Step 3: Compare with content vectors (posts, questions, groups, users).
  - Step 4: Combine BM25 (keyword) + cosine similarity (semantic).

### Technology:

- Embedding model: OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, Cohere, or PhoBERT/viBERT (for on-premise).
- DB for vectors: Postgres + pgvector or Weaviate / Milvus.
- Search engine: Meilisearch or Elasticsearch + Vietnamese analyzer plugin.

### KPI:

- CTR (click-through rate) after search.
- Time-to-result < 300ms.
- Recall@k and MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank).

## 3) Newsfeed Recommendation System

### Goal:

- Personalize newsfeed by:
  - Friends (friend graph).
  - Interested subject tags.
  - Behavior (like, comment, bookmark).

### How it works:

- Candidate generation (pre-filter):
  - Get posts from direct friends.
  - Get posts with tags matching user profile.
  - Get trending posts (most votes in 24h).

### Technology:

- Embedding model for post & user: same as search.
- Recommender system:
  - Collaborative filtering (user‚Äìitem matrix).
  - Graph-based recommend (PageRank on friend graph).
  - Hybrid (tag-based + friend-based + embedding).
- Infrastructure:
  - Candidate store = Redis/Elasticsearch.
  - Ranking model = LightGBM/NN (trained from click/vote logs).

### KPI:

- Avg session length (users browse feed longer).
- CTR for posts in feed.
- Diversity (not too repetitive).
- Retention D7 (user retention after 7 days).

## Overall Data Flow

### 1. Input:

Content (post, comment, group, tags) + user behavior (like, comment, save, follow).

### 2. AI pipeline:

- Moderation ‚Üí filter toxic/spam comments.
- Embedding ‚Üí save vectors for search & recommend.
- Ranking ‚Üí personalized feed sorting.

### 3. Output:

- Safe comments.
- Accurate, semantic search.
- Personalized newsfeed by friends & tags.

## Summary

- Moderation: AI NLP filters toxic/spam, helps mods avoid overload.
- Search: AI semantic search + typo correction, supports Vietnamese.
- Newsfeed: AI recommender combines friends + subject tags + behavior ‚Üí personalized feed.
